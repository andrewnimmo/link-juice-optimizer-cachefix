Replace links with a clickable &lt;span&gt; tag, add the nofollow attribute or remove the href attribute to optimize link juice.

== Description ==

The plugin allows to obfuscate links in 3 parts of our WordPress:

+ Menu items.
+ Links within post and page content.
+ Links within the content of HTML widgets.

To obfuscate a link, the only thing you have to do is to apply the class "ljoptimizer", then the plugin will do its job using PHP and Javascript functions.

== Installation ==
1. Visit the plugins page within your dashboard, select ‘Add New’ and search for ‘Super Sitemap for SEO’ or upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to the plugin settings after activation to choose your settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
